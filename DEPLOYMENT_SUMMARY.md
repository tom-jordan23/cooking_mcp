## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Family-Scale Deployment (Railway)

1. **Setup Railway account and connect GitHub repository**
2. **Configure environment variables from `.env.railway`**
3. **Deploy with automatic build and monitoring**

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh

# Deploy application
railway login
railway up
```

### Family-Scale Deployment (VPS)

1. **Prepare VPS with Docker and Docker Compose**
2. **Clone repository and configure environment**
3. **Deploy with automated script**

```bash
# Clone and configure
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cooking_mcp.git
cd cooking_mcp
cp .env.production .env
# Edit .env with actual values

# Deploy
./scripts/deploy.sh -t family -e production
```

### Production Kubernetes Deployment

1. **Prepare Kubernetes cluster with ingress controller**
2. **Configure secrets and environment variables**
3. **Deploy with automated pipeline or manual deployment**

```bash
# Configure secrets
kubectl create namespace cooking-mcp
kubectl create secret generic cooking-mcp-secrets --from-env-file=.env.production -n cooking-mcp

# Deploy
./scripts/deploy.sh -t k8s -e production
```
